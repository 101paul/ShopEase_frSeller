# 🚀 Full-Stack Android eCommerce Solution – Buyer & Seller Apps
(This is the seller version of the app)
An end-to-end **native Android eCommerce ecosystem**, designed to deliver a seamless, real-time, and secure experience for both **buyers** and **sellers**.

## 📱 Two Apps – One Powerful Ecosystem

This project includes **two fully functional Android applications**, built from the ground up:

- 🛒 **Buyer App** – For browsing products, managing cart, placing orders, making secure payments, and tracking delivery.
- 🛍️ **Seller App** – For uploading products, managing stock, and processing incoming orders.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

- **Kotlin + XML** – Modern, fast, and intuitive native UI development
- **MVVM Architecture** – Clean code separation and lifecycle-aware components
- **Room Database** – Efficient offline access and persistent cart state
- **SharedPreferences** – Lightweight local state management
- **Firebase Realtime Database** – Instant syncing of orders, stock, and product data
- **Firebase Cloud Storage** – Fast and scalable image uploads & retrieval

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

- **OTP Login via Firebase Authentication**
  - Secure, passwordless access
  - Fast mobile number verification
  - Seamless onboarding for both buyers and sellers

---

## 💳 Payment Gateway Integration

- **Razorpay Payment Gateway**
  - Smooth and secure payment flow
  - Handles multiple payment methods (UPI, cards, wallets)

- **Custom Java + Spring Boot Backend**
  - Generates secure Razorpay order IDs
  - Validates and verifies payment transactions
  - Protects sensitive user credentials
  - Ensures full-stack transaction integrity

---

## ⚡ Real-Time Buyer-Seller Sync

- Live updates on:
  - New orders
  - Stock changes
  - Product additions or edits
- Instant notification to buyers when orders are packed, shipped, or delivered

---

## 🧠 Smart Cart & Order Management

- Real-time cart updates using Room + Firebase
- Auto-clears cart when quantity hits zero
- Post-order stock deductions reflected immediately in the seller app

---

## ✅ Why This App Stands Out

- 100% **native Android** development
- Clean, scalable **MVVM** architecture
- Full-stack: From **UI to backend payment verification**
- **Secure**, **real-time**, and **production-ready**
- Offline support for smoother experience
- Ideal for launching a **mobile-first eCommerce solution**
